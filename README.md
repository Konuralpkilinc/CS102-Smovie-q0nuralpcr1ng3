## **Details About Smovie**
- "Smovie" is an application which makes multiple film suggestions to the user based on their decisions whether they like, dislike, or do not have any idea about numerous other films. Each bunch of suggestions target specifically that current user, since every unique person’s interest and film taste are also unique.
- As the users open the app, they are given a login page. They will register or login into the app. They will insert their password and username to login and register.
- After logging in, the users are given film posters on by one, and are required to answer only one question about each film: “ What is your opinion about this movie? “
- **There are three options**:
- Like
- Dislike
- No opinion
- 	This procedure continues for 30 films of various genres. These 30 films are chosen randomly among a film collection of 200 films. 
	As the users accomplish evaluating all films, they are suggested 5 films based on their evaluations. 
	During the compilation process of a user’s liking inputs, an overall movie taste of the user is determined. 
	Determining the users’ film taste and the related  suggestion is done according to the received inputs, specifying the common points in chosen 		movies’ genres. 
	For example, if the user has chosen a movie that contains horror and drama elements the most, movies which contain drama and horror elements that the user hasn’t seen yet will take place among the 5 suggestions. 
	The users’ selections and received suggestions are saved by the application with their profile informations. After finishing the survey and receiving the film list, users are offered a “BLEND” option. 
	When the user chooses the “BLEND” option, they are asked to choose the profiles from an “Existing Profiles” list that they want a film suggestion blend with.
	The data collected from chosen users are used to measure the compatibility of answers to create a blended movie suggestion.
	Then, the app will be able to create and present to the user the suggestion list of 5 films, which include common elements and genres, and would suit all chosen users’ interests so that they can watch that movies together. 
	Additional features such as common movies watched by all users in the blend can be further implemented.
All profiles in a blend can see all the blends they take part in, even if they are not the owner (creator) of that blend.
